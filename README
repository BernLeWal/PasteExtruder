Stepper drived paste/dual-paste extruder

WORK UNDER PROGRESS

New design using M5 threaded rod to drive the syringe instead of gears,
uses less mechanical parts an makes possible to creat a design for dual extruder
with the stepper motors directly mounted on the x carriage.

To be used with a RepRap (Prusa / Mendel / Air).
